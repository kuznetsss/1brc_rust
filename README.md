Simple solution for [1 billion rows challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc).

I assumed to have a limitation to use only standard library and no crates.

The solution has multithread mode (default, 8 threads) and single thread modes (activated by `-s` flag). Also printing result could be disabled by `-q` flag. Because I'm not using any crates cli flags processing is very basic.

On my mac single thread solution takes 80 seconds, multithread solution takes 12 seconds (input file is 14 GB).

## Getting data

File `measurements.txt` is required to be in the repo to measure performance.
It could be generated by steps from [1brc's instruction](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc?tab=readme-ov-file#running-the-challenge).
I used docker, because I don't have java on my mac:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/
cd 1brc
docker run -it --mount source=$(pwd),target=/home eclipse-temurin:21 /bin/bash
# inside docker:
cd home
./mvnw clean verify
./create_measurements.sh 1000000000
exit
# on host
mv ./measurements.txt <1brc_rust path>

```
